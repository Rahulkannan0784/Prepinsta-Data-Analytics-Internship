# Superstore Sales Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Superstore Sales dataset analysis project. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset to gain insights into retail sales from a global superstore over four years.

## Dataset Overview

The Superstore Sales dataset contains information about retail sales from a global superstore, including various attributes such as product categories, sales figures, customer segments, shipping details, and more.

## Analysis Tasks

The analysis of the Superstore Sales dataset includes the following tasks:

1. **Data Understanding:** Exploring the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, and understanding the meaning of each attribute.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, if any, and checking for data anomalies to ensure data quality.

3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for key numeric variables.

4. **Histograms:** Creating histograms to visualize the distribution of key numeric variables, such as sales figures.

5. **Time Series Plots:** Plotting time series graphs to understand sales trends over the four-year period.

6. **Seasonal Decomposition:** Decomposing time series data into components like trend, seasonality, and residuals for deeper insights.

7. **Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between variables, including correlation analysis, scatter plots, pair plots, and more.

8. **Documentation:** Documenting key findings and insights obtained from the analysis using visualizations and summary statistics.

## Tools Used
