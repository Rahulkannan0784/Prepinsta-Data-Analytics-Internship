# Week 3 Internship Program

Welcome to my week 3 internship program! In this assignment, I analyzed two different datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Then notebooks cover a variety of analyses on two datasets, including handling missing values, examining data types, identifying outliers, and ensuring data integrity. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the data analysis process, providing insights and recommendations for further analysis.

## Analysis Notebooks

1. **Dataset 1 Analysis:**
   - **Google Colab Notebook:** [Click to view](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SxzoImiaeMoA34PmmqFLQfdF1kyoaLbp?usp=sharing)
   - **Description:** This notebook examines the dataset for missing values in each indicator (e.g., Age, Salary, Rating) and provides recommendations on how to handle them for each indicator. The analysis aims to ensure data completeness and integrity for further analysis.
2. **Dataset 2 Analysis:**
   - **Google Colab Notebook:** [Click to view](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k9_w05cA-OdlJHCZ_6F54lRaRsLSQMB9?usp=sharing)
   - **Description:** This analysis involves verifying the data types of each column in the Chipotle dataset, including Order ID, Quantity, Item Name, Choice Description, and Item Price. The goal is to ensure that the data types align with their expected types (e.g., numerical, categorical) and determine if any adjustments are necessary for accurate analysis.

## Dependencies

The analysis was conducted using Python with the following dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Instructions

To run the analysis notebooks:
1. Click on the links provided above to open the respective Google Colab notebooks.
2. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code and view the analysis results.

## Feedback
