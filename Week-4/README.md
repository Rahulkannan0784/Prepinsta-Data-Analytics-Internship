# Week 4: World Bank Data Analysis and Visualization

In Week 4 of the Data Analytics Internship with Prepinsta, I focused on analyzing and visualizing World Bank data related to life expectancy, fertility rate, and country population. The tasks included:

## Tasks Completed

1. **Loading Data:** Loaded datasets containing information about life expectancy, fertility rate, and country population.
2. **Data Overview:** Reviewed the structure and content of the datasets to understand their characteristics.
3. **Handling Missing Values:** Checked for missing values in the datasets and handled them appropriately.
4. **Data Types:** Ensured that data types were appropriate for analysis and visualization.
5. **Merging DataFrames:** Merged datasets using the Pandas `merge` method to combine relevant information.

## Visualization Tasks

1. **Animated Graph:** Reproduced an animated graph similar to Hans Rosling's TED talk using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
2. **Population Trends:** Created a line graph depicting population trends over the years.
3. **Fertility Rate Distribution:** Visualized the distribution of fertility rates across regions.
4. **Life Expectancy Variation:** Analyzed the variation in life expectancy across different regions.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Explored the correlation between variables such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and population.
6. **Regional Analysis:** Conducted a detailed analysis of regional trends in life expectancy, fertility rate, and population.

## Insights and Reflections

- **Challenges Faced:** Highlighted any challenges encountered during the tasks and how they were addressed.
- **Key Learnings:** Summarized the key learnings and insights gained from the tasks completed.
- **Future Directions:** Discussed potential areas for further exploration and improvement in data analysis and visualization skills.

This week provided a deep dive into analyzing and visualizing real-world datasets, offering practical experience in data analytics techniques and tools. The animated graph and other visualizations produced during this week showcase my growing proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
